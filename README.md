Jupyter notebook for cognitive neuroscience research project: Age Related Changes to Functional Brain Networks during Executive Function: â€‹Meta-analytical Co-Activation Mapping

This is a meta-analysis project I worked on since sophomore year of college. From the data I acquired, I was able to vizualize the shift of brain network centrality from the prefrontal cortex to more medial and posterior regions. 

In my data analysis I used the following libraries:
- NetworkX
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
